# Pomidor

A [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) implemented
as a persistent IPC daemon, for easy integration with custom desktops.

Pomodoro is Italian for "tomato," and помидор (pomidor) is Russian for "tomato."

There will be all sorts of neato-keeno documentation and screenshots here at some point.
