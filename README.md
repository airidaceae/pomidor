# Pomidor

A [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) implemented
as a persistent IPC daemon, for easy integration with custom desktops.

Pomodoro is Italian for "tomato," and помидор (pomidor) is Russian for "tomato."

There will be all sorts of neato-keeno documentation and screenshots here at some point.

## Features
- "pester mode" gets you to actually use it
- batteries-included Waybar integration
- highly configurable
- CLI-based timer interaction
- customizable desktop notifications for timer alarms

## Todo
- [ ] Configurable sounds (not supported by all notification daemons)
  - perhaps the deamon could play the sound?
- [ ] Time counting modes
- [ ] interim periods between focus and breaks
- [ ] AUR package
- [ ] waybar instructions
- [ ] screenshots in readme
- [ ] improve code organization
